# hashset
This is a hashset implementation by William Kraft (ZekeWK).

It is NOT YET TESTED properly.

As I am a novice in C, I leave no guarantees as to the quality, speed, or correctness of the code.
 
While it is written primarily as a hashset, it can be used as a hashmap by only using the key in the hash and eq functions supplied to the hashset_create function.

It uses an open addressing double hashing algorithm.
